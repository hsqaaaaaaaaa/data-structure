In this study, shear damage development of four precast bridge columns with different connection design details are first examined via quasi-static test. The short columns are of identical dimension and reinforcement arrangement for both pier and footing segments, and the span-to-depth ratio is 0.85 for shear study. The connection utilizes grouted splice sleeve (GSS) couplers for all four specimens. Different bonding materials are compared, effectiveness of shear keys is investigated, and variation of steel rebar grades is carried out. It is found that epoxy retain lower bond strength than high strength mortar, lower grade of longitudinal rebar significantly reduces shear strength of bridge column, and shear keys are of limited effectiveness on the overall shear damage development. An analytical method for shear strength calculation is then proposed and calibrated based on different test results, which incorporates possible influencing factors for shear strength estimation. Maximum difference between the test results and estimated strength values are less than 10%, and it indicates that the proposed method can be used as a reference for shear strength estimation of short precast bridge columns for seismic strength estimation.

The short columns are of identical dimension and reinforcement arrangement for both pier and footing segments, and the span-to-depth ratio is 0.85 for shear study. The connection utilizes grouted splice sleeve (GSS) couplers for all four specimens. Different bonding materials are compared, effectiveness of shear keys is investigated, and variation of steel rebar grades is carried out. It is found that epoxy retain lower bond strength than high strength mortar, lower grade of longitudinal rebar significantly reduces shear strength of bridge column, and shear keys are of limited effectiveness on the overall shear damage development. An analytical method for shear strength calculation is then proposed and calibrated based on different test results, which incorporates possible influencing factors for shear strength estimation. Maximum difference between the test results and estimated strength values are less than 10%, and it indicates that the proposed method can be used as a reference for shear strength estimation of short precast bridge columns for seismic strength estimation.
