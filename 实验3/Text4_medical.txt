A standardised, single-centre cross-sectional imaging protocol was utilised to investigate cortical grey matter and cerebral white matter alterations in 36 poliomyelitis survivors in contrast to healthy individuals and patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as a ‘disease-control’ group. [1] T1-weighted imaging and 32-direction diffusion tensor imaging data were obtained on a 3 Tesla Philips Achieva MRI system, using an IR-SPGR sequence and SE-EPI sequence respectively. Raw region-of-interest data and percentage change with respect to reference estimated marginal mean values are presented for grey and white matter metrics in key anatomical regions. Poliomyelitis survivors exhibit no frank grey or white matter degeneration. To the contrary, increased partial volumes can be detected in the brainstem, cerebellum and occipital lobes compared to healthy individuals. Higher fractional anisotropy was also noted in the corticospinal tracts, cerebellum, bilateral mesial temporal lobes and inferior frontal brain regions in poliomyelitis survivors in contrast to controls. Anatomical patterns of superior integrity metrics in polio survivors were concordant with anatomical regions of focal degeneration in ALS. Our imaging data indicate cortical and white matter reorganisation in polio survivors, which may be interpreted as compensatory adaptation to severe lower motor neuron injury acquired in infancy.A standardised, single-centre cross-sectional imaging protocol was utilised to investigate cortical grey matter and cerebral white matter alterations in 36 poliomyelitis survivors in contrast to healthy individuals and patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as a ‘disease-control’ group.

Poliomyelitis survivors exhibit no frank grey or white matter degeneration. To the contrary, increased partial volumes can be detected in the brainstem, cerebellum and occipital lobes compared to healthy individuals. Higher fractional anisotropy was also noted in the corticospinal tracts, cerebellum, bilateral mesial temporal lobes and inferior frontal brain regions in poliomyelitis survivors in contrast to controls. Anatomical patterns of superior integrity metrics in polio survivors were concordant with anatomical regions of focal degeneration in ALS. Our imaging data indicate cortical and white matter reorganisation in polio survivors, which may be interpreted as compensatory adaptation to severe lower motor neuron injury acquired in infancy.A standardised, single-centre cross-sectional imaging protocol was utilised to investigate cortical grey matter and cerebral white matter alterations in 36 poliomyelitis survivors in contrast to healthy individuals and patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as a ‘disease-control’ group. [1] T1-weighted imaging and 32-direction diffusion tensor imaging data were obtained on a 3 Tesla Philips Achieva MRI system, using an IR-SPGR sequence and SE-EPI sequence respectively. Raw region-of-interest data and percentage change with respect to reference estimated marginal mean values are presented for grey and white matter metrics in key anatomical regions.
